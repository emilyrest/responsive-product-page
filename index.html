            <p>Here's the scoop from Dough p's founder on how this flavor came to be: "I first made Red Velvet on a total whim, just a few months into business in 2017. One day, while mixing up Doughp at our original commercial kitchen in Oakland, I left to grab some lunch at a nearby bakery. </p>
          </article>

          <article>
            <p>I saw an absolutely delicious-looking red velvet cake in their dessert case and immediately thought: I NEED to know what this tastes like in cookie dough! I bought the cake and mixed it right into a small 51b batch of Doughp; cream cheese frosting, cake and all! HEAVEN by the spoonful!"</p>
